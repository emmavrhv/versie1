::div{.futura} 
This was an assignment in the second semester of the first year
of my education in media & information design at sint-lukas school of arts in
Brussels. 

For this assignment, I had to search for color contrasts in my
surroundings and then recreate them using acrylic paint. I was required to
index these color palettes and incorporate them into a medium.

I decided to connect this assignment to color, as color and emotions go hand in hand. Music and emotions do this as well, so this was a way for me to index the colors in a personal and deeper manner. The albums I chose represent the colors found in each color palette.
